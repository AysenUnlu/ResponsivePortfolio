Responsive Portfolio
First, I used Bootstrap CSS Framework to recreate my portfolio. Responsiveness is achiewed through bootstrap. Media queries used to change
the navigation bar for small and xsmall screens. Following pages are created:

index.html: Includes a short biography.
portfolio.html: Contains image placeholders to link to projects in the future
contact.html: The user enters his name and email, sends a message

Using Bootstrap, my portfolio site is created with the following items:


A navbar : Bootstrap navbar is used. To change the layout for navigation bar for small and x-small screens media queries are used 
A responsive layout: Layout is responsive through bootstrap.
Responsive images: Images are responsive as well

I used Bootstrap's grid system for my "about me" page, so text will wrap around the image with large and medium screen sizes.
Grid System is used for "portfolio page" as well with subrows so images and headings repositioned without breaking.
On small and larger screens, I have margins on left and right sides of the screen. On xs screen, content takes up entire screen.
